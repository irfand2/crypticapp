**Description**

This is a simple cryptography project that provides 3 encryption methods:
Ceasar Chipper, XOR, SHA1 hashing. Decryptors for Ceasar and XOR are also provided.
The UI is very simple, and thus the app is easy to use. This app is great for ordinary
people who want to keep their files/texts from easy access by normal people (not hackers
or crypto experts), ie. for those who don't need overly complex algorithms.

**Dependencies/Libraries Used**
   - Cmake
   - Visual Studio 2015
   - Cinder
   - Cinder-SHA1 block (for SHA1 hashing)
   - Cinder-ImGui (for UI)
   
**How to use**

Just start the program, choose encryption or decryption, enter your text and key,
choose a method, and receive your encrypted/decrypted text!
