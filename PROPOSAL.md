# A "Crpytic" App

I am planning to do a project on cryptography. I want to create
a program that encrypts and decrypts texts using a variety of
encryption methods. Some of these methods can be simple and can be
implemented by me, such as Ceasar chipping, and others can be more
complex and thus would require me to use a library.

I want to do this project because I am very interested in mathematical
algorithms, especially hashing algorithms and cryptography. I took
a class in number theory and learned about its applications in
encryption, and I have been interested in the topic since then.
I also read several articles and some simple papers on the topic,
so I have considerable background information regarding the subject.
My main goal in this project is to learn more about encryption
algorithms by implementing them and by using related libraries.
My self-interest in the topic will motivate me to complete the
project.

One library I plan to use is the "Cinder-SHA1" block. SHA1 is a
complex hashing algorithm that can be used for encryption, so
this will be an appropriate and interesting library to use.

By the end of week 1, I plan to implement one or two simple encryption
methods, and use a library to implement a more complex encryption method. 

By the end of week 2, I plan to get started with the user interface, and make
some progress towards finishing it.

By the end of week 3,
I plan to finish the UI and wrap everything up: debug, write tests, comments, organize my code. 

If I finish early, I plan to implement a complex encryption method myself
without using a library.
